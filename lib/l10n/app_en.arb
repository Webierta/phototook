    "aboutIntro1": "**PhotoTook** searches for photos on top image platforms, including Unsplash, Pexels, Flickr, Pixabay and Openverse. In future revisions, these sources may be modified or expanded.",
    "aboutIntro2": "The app accesses photos from the platforms through their API and has no official relationship with any of them. Each platform owns its registered trademark and logo and this application is not sponsored or supported by any.",
    "aboutIntro3": "The app allows you to use some filters to search for photos, such as predominant color and orientation, although not all platforms support these filters.",
    "aboutIntro4": "The application presents the images and associated information in different layouts, and allows you to perform some actions on the images: bookmark, zoom, share and download to your device.",
    "aboutIntro5": "From the download action, the application tries to get the original image, but when that option is not available (due to server limitation or any other reason) then it tries to download the image with the largest possible size",
    "aboutIntro6": "Use the favorites section as a temporary storage that takes up almost no memory. Note that no images are saved, only the links and data of that image, and some platforms generate dynamic links that update from time to time, so it is possible that some functions (such as downloading or zooming) may stop working on some saved favorites (only applicable to some platforms). It is also possible that an image saved in favorites may no longer be available on the platform. If you intend to use the images in the future, it is best to download them to your device.",
