#### META SEARCH ENGINE FOR PHOTOS ON THE BEST IMAGES PLATFORMS

---

**PhotoTook** searches for photos on top image platforms, including Unsplash, Pexels, Flickr, Pixabay and Openverse. In future revisions, these sources may be modified or expanded.

The app accesses photos from the platforms through their API and has no official relationship with any of them.

The app allows you to use some filters to search for photos, such as predominant color and orientation, although not all platforms support filters.

The application presents the images and associated information in different layouts and allows you to save images as favorites.
