PhotoTook searches for photos on top image platforms, including Unsplash, Pexels, Flickr, Pixabay and Openverse. In future revisions, these sources may be modified or expanded.

The app accesses photos from the platforms through their API and has no official relationship with any of them. Each platform owns its registered trademark and logo and this application is not sponsored or supported by any.

The application presents the images and associated information in different layouts, and allows you to perform some actions on the images: bookmark, zoom, share and download to your device.
